# ip-address-tracker
 This website uses Leaflet API and IP Geolocation API to track the location of a given IP address. 
## Overview
 This is a Frontend Mentor Challenge, of Intermediate difficulty.
 <br>It uses [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) and [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/) to track the location of a given IP address.
 <br>The website first loads the user's location based on their IP Address. 
 <br>It was a very fun project to code. I added my own small touches to it, but it closely follows the initial design. 
 <br>The whole thing took me around 4 hours to finish
